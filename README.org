Tool for generating tests in LaTeX from an Org-mode file.

* Introduction
This is a tool for generating LaTeX tests from an Org file.  It is
based on the default Org-mode LaTeX exporter, with provisions for
a few education-related features.  Currently, the following things are
supported:
- single- and multiple-choice tests
- cloze tests (gap filling)
- free-form questions

The exporter is heavily based on its twin project, [[https://github.com/mbork/org-edu-html][Org-Edu-HTML
exporter]], sharing the syntax with it.

* Installation
Put =org-edu-latex.el= somewhere in the =load-path= and =(require
'org-edu-latex)=.  Put =org-edu.sty= somewhere LaTeX will find it (the
simplest possibility is in the same directory (folder) as your
document).

* Usage
See [[https://github.com/mbork/org-edu-html][Org-Edu-HTML exporter]].
